### Hey there, I'm Kai!

I'm a 17 year old maker from Canada hacking on PCB's, building hardware and travelling!

I've done a lot of cool things like:
- Ran a popup cafe in China with other hackers
- Ran my own hackathon with the goal of building the dumbest thing possible
- Went on an 4-day cross-country train hackathon across Canada
- Went to GitHub HQ for the largest hardware hackathon for highschoolers in SF
- Went to Canada's largest hackathon, Hack the North in waterloo!
- And so much more!

You can read about all my cool adventures in my [journal](https://kaipereira.com/journal)!

Current I'm designing a: 
- [an M.2 FPGA hardware accelerator devboard](https://github.com/KaiPereira/FPGA-Accelerator)

I'm actively building a: 
- [stacked acrylic keyboard](https://github.com/KaiPereira/PR1SM)
