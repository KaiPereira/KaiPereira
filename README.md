### Hey there, I'm Kai!

I'm a 17 year old maker from Canada hacking on PCB's, building hardware and travelling!

I've done a lot of cool things like:
- Ran a popup cafe in China with other hackers
- Ran my own hackathon with the goal of building the dumbest thing possible
- Went on an 4-day cross-country train hackathon across Canada
- Attended one of the largest hardware hackathons for highschoolers in SF
- Went to Canada's largest hackathon, Hack the North in waterloo!
- And so much more!

You can read about all my cool adventures in my [journal](https://kaipereira.com/journal)!

Current I'm designing a:
