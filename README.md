### Hey there, I'm Kai!

I'm a 17 year old maker from Canada hacking on PCB's, building hardware and exploring!

I've done a lot of cool things like:
- Ran a popup cafe in China with other hackers
- Ran my own hackathon with the goal of building the dumbest thing possible
- Went on an 8-day cross-country train hackathon across Canada
- Attended one of the largest hardware hackathons for highschoolers in SF
- And so much more!

You can read about all my cool adventures in my [journal](https://kaipereira.com/journal)!

Current I'm designing an: 
- [8-node ITX cluster board](https://github.com/KaiPereira/Cluster-Board)

I'm actively building a: 
- [keyboard](https://github.com/KaiPereira/PR1SM)
- [a macropad](https://github.com/KaiPereira/CYBERPAD-01)
- [3D printer motherboard](https://github.com/KaiPereira/Cheetah-MX4-Mini)
